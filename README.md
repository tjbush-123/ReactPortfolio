## Description

My motivation was to make something that was specific to me and me only. I built this project to show my accomplishments so far. This project solves the problem of me not having something to help me in the future. I learned how to use react and how to use it in different ways.

## Installation

To get started clone this repository run npm i to install all the necessary files.
```
git clone git@github.com:tjbush-123/ReactPortfolio.git
```

## Usage

Your task is to create a portfolio, using your new React skills to help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios donâ€™t use the latest technologies.

## Credits

This is a solo project
